# Math Documentation

This folder contains all pre-coding mathematical derivations used in the Panther Cloud Air simulation project.

All calculations related to flight time, fuel usage, passenger demand, revenue, and profit are fully derived and validated here before implementation. These documents serve as the single source of truth for the system’s logic and are referenced directly during development to ensure correctness and consistency.
